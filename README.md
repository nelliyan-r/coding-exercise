## Overview
Build us something using the Flickr API, we would like to be able to search and browse pictures. Included is a basic app skeleton and some stub components you can use or toss out completely, your choice. We do however have some expectations regarding your use of source control (Git) and your environment (Android Studio).

## System Requirements
We use Git extensively, so being comfortable working with a distributed version control system is a must.

On Android Studio, we feel that the modern tools recommended by Google for Android development are far and way better than the old toolset, that means you should get comfortable reading and modifying Gradle build scripts.

## Getting Started
Create a Flickr app API key for use in your app: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/
We stored our key in the Constants.java class (actually it's just an empty string in our repository), but you could put it in another place if you wish.

You can get Android Studio directly from Google if you don't already have it: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
